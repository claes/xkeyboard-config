This is an experimental fork of xkeyboard-config. It initially focuses on 
adding keyboard mappings for cursor movement from the home row. 

Example to try it out, after installation:

setxkbmap -layout "se+editing+level3(caps_switch)"

Loads swedish keyboard. Adds cursor key movement (ijkl = ↑←↓→)
plus unix-inspired keys for deletion and line movement (h, d, a, e), all
accessible with AltGr. Additionally, it maps AltGr to Caps Lock.

More examples:

setxkbmap -layout "us+editing(vi_move)+level3(caps_switch)"
setxkbmap -layout "dk+editing(emacs_move)+editing(unix_delete)+level3(caps_switch)"

See symbols/editing for additional variants.
